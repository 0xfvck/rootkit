<p id="description">A simple Rootkit made by me to hide files in python.</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. 1</p>

```
First save the code into a file named hide_processes_files.c.
```

<p>2. 2</p>

```
Next open up a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
```

<p>3. 3</p>

```
Time to compile the code! Type gcc -o hide_processes_files hide_processes_files.c and hit enter.
```

<p>4. 4</p>

```
Once it's compiled run the program by typing ./hide_processes_files and hitting enter again.
```

<p>5. 5</p>

```
This will hide the current process and file and also add any additional hidden processes and files you specify with their corresponding PIDs and paths.
```

<p>6. 6</p>

```
If you want to hide a specific process use the ocultar_proceso() function and give it the process ID and a name.
```

<p>7. 7</p>

```
To hide a specific file use the ocultar_archivo() function and provide it the file path and a name.
```

<p>8. 8</p>

```
The program will keep hiding the processes and files as long as it's running so sit back and relax.
```

<p>9. 9</p>

```
When you're ready to stop the program use the kill command with the process ID (PID) of the hide_processes_files program.
```

<p>10. 10</p>

```
If you ever need to check out the list of hidden processes use the mostrar_procesos_ocultos() function.
```
